# Groq API Key Configuration Guide

## Current Status

You have successfully set up the Groq API key in your Chatbot AI application. The system is now sending requests to the Groq API and receiving real AI responses.

## How the API Key is Used

1. The API key is read from the `.env` file when the application starts up
2. It is stored in the global `GROQ_API_KEY` variable
3. The `query_groq_api` function uses this global variable to authenticate with the Groq API
4. If the key is valid, real AI responses are returned from Groq's LLM models

## Testing the API Key

You can verify the API key is working correctly by:

1. Running the test script: `python backend/test_chat_final.py`
2. This test script will:
   - Create a test conversation
   - Send a message that should trigger a real API call
   - Verify that the response is from the real Groq AI and not a mock

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing mock responses, check the following:

1. **API Key Format**: Ensure your API key follows the format `gsk_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
2. **Environment File**: Make sure the .env file has the correct line: `GROQ_API_KEY = your_actual_key_here`
3. **Server Restart**: Always restart the backend server after updating the API key
4. **Check Logs**: Look for "Calling Groq API with key:" in the server logs to confirm the API is being called
5. **Port Configuration**: The application is now configured to run on port 8001 - make sure all frontend requests go to this port

## API Key Security

- Your API key is masked in the logs for security (only first 5 and last 5 characters are shown)
- Never commit the .env file with a real API key to version control
- For production deployment, consider using environment variables or a secure key vault

## Additional Notes

- The system includes a mock response system for development without a valid API key
- To revert to mock responses, set the API key to "your_new_api_key_here" or remove it
